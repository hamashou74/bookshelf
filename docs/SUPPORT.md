# Support

This document explains how to get help and how to contact the maintainers for different types of requests.

GitHub will surface this file to users when creating an issue, so please follow the guidance below.

## Before asking for help

Please check the following first:

- `README.md` (project overview and status)
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (how we prefer to receive contributions and reports)
- `docs/ISSUE_TRIAGE.md` (how issues are categorized and processed)

If you are reporting a problem, include:

- What you expected to happen vs. what happened
- Steps to reproduce (as minimal as possible)
- Logs or screenshots (redact secrets)
- Environment details (OS, versions, etc.)

## Where to ask questions

### General questions / how-to

- If GitHub Discussions is enabled, use it for questions and open-ended support.
- If Discussions is not enabled, open an issue using the most appropriate template and clearly mark it as a question in the description.

### Bugs

Use the **Fix** issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/02-fix.yaml`).
Include reproduction steps and the smallest example you can provide.

### Feature requests / enhancements

Use the **Feature** issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-feature.yaml`).
Explain the use case, user impact, and (if possible) acceptance criteria.

### Maintenance tasks (docs, refactors, tooling)

Use the **Chore** issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/03-chore.yaml`).

### Release planning

Use the **Release** issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/04-release.yaml`) for coordinating planned releases.

### Hotfix requests

Use the **Hotfix** issue form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/05-hotfix.yaml`) for urgent production-impacting issues.

## Security issues

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for suspected vulnerabilities.
Please follow the instructions in `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## Expected response times

This project is maintained on a best-effort basis.

- We aim to acknowledge new issues when possible.
- Time-to-resolution depends on severity, clarity of the report, and maintainer availability.

If your issue is time-sensitive, state the reason and impact clearly.

## Support boundaries

At the current stage (early development), support is limited to:

- Clarifying project direction and planned features
- Reviewing well-scoped issues and pull requests
- Guidance on contribution workflow

We generally cannot provide:

- Guaranteed SLAs
- One-to-one consulting or bespoke integrations
- Debugging of unrelated third-party environments without a reproducible case

## Conduct

All interactions are governed by `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
If you need to report conduct-related concerns, follow the reporting process described there.

## Languages

English is preferred for issues and pull requests to maximize contributor reach.
Japanese is acceptable if you include clear steps and expected/actual behavior.
