# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project is committed to providing a safe, respectful, and professional environment for everyone who participates—users, contributors, reviewers, and maintainers.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including (but not limited to):

- GitHub issues, pull requests, code reviews, discussions, and comments
- Project documentation and community channels managed by the project
- Public interactions where someone is representing the project (e.g., talks, posts using official accounts)

## Expected behavior

We expect all participants to:

- Treat others with respect, professionalism, and empathy
- Assume good intent and ask for clarification before escalating
- Provide constructive feedback focused on the work, not the person
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Be mindful of inclusive language and accessibility where practical

## Unacceptable behavior

The following are not acceptable in project spaces:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Personal attacks, insults, trolling, or sustained hostility
- Sexualized comments, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Doxxing or sharing private information without explicit consent
- Threats of violence or encouragement of self-harm
- Deliberate disruption of discussions, reviews, or project work

## Maintainer responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Interpreting and enforcing this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly
- Taking appropriate moderation actions (e.g., editing/removing content, locking threads, restricting participation)
- Communicating reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate
- Protecting reporters’ privacy and handling reports sensitively

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. Prefer private reporting when possible.
2. Use the contact method listed in `docs/SECURITY.md` (recommended) to reach maintainers confidentially.
3. If confidential reporting is not available, open a GitHub issue titled `[Conduct] ...` and **do not include** sensitive personal data. A maintainer may move the discussion to a private channel if needed.
4. For immediate platform-level concerns, you may also use GitHub’s built-in reporting tools.

We will review and investigate reports promptly and as fairly as possible.

## Privacy

We will keep reports confidential to the extent reasonably possible and only share details on a need-to-know basis (e.g., to investigate or to enforce consequences).

## Enforcement guidelines

Maintainers may apply consequences proportionate to the impact and severity of the violation, including:

### 1. Guidance / Correction

**Typical impact:** Unprofessional or unwelcome language; minor first-time issues.
**Likely response:** A private note explaining the concern and expectations; a request to edit/remove content; possible request for an apology.

### 2. Formal Warning

**Typical impact:** A repeated minor issue or a notable single incident.
**Likely response:** A written warning with clear conditions; temporary “no-contact” expectations regarding specific participants or threads.

### 3. Temporary Restriction

**Typical impact:** Serious misconduct or sustained disruptive behavior.
**Likely response:** Temporary limits on participation (e.g., time-bounded ban from issues/PRs/discussions); additional conditions for return.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Typical impact:** A pattern of harmful behavior, targeted harassment, threats, or severe violations.
**Likely response:** Permanent removal from project spaces.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal by contacting maintainers via the confidential channel referenced in `docs/SECURITY.md`. Provide context and any relevant links. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved where feasible.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by established open-source community standards, including the Contributor Covenant (v2.1).
